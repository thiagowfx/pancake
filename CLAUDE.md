- Follow @op_login_all/ as a canonical style / pattern for shell scripts.
    - In general, follow the Google Shell style guide.
    - Ensure shellcheck passes (via pre-commit).
    - Use a "main" function.
    - Every script must support -h / --help for usage instructions.
    - In particular, always include a user-friendly README.md.
    - *DO NOT* use ALL CAPS. Exception: headers. For example: "OPTIONS:".
    - Avoid "please". Be direct and succinct.
    - Always test the script works as expected. Write unit tests whenever it
      makes sense to do so.
    - Use clever / funny placeholders when illustrating ID / input examples.
