DESCRIPTION:
    This script discovers all 1Password accounts configured on the system

    login attempt and a summary at the end.

PREREQUISITES:
    - 1Password CLI ('op') must be installed
    - Accounts must be added using 'op account add'
    - 'jq' must be installed for JSON parsing

EXAMPLES:
    $0              Log into all accounts
    $0 --help       Show this help

EXIT CODES:
    0    All accounts logged in successfully
    1    Some or all accounts failed to log in, or no accounts found
